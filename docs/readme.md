# Welcome!

To make sure annoying bugs are kept to a minimum, we're providing a more detailled guide for setting up the coding environment for implementing the lab.

We'll be using the following software:
- CCS (Development Environment for pushing the code to the board)
- Sublime Text 3 (Text editor with syntax highlighting)
- RealTerm (Terminal for real-time communication over the USB port)

Guides are provided for both the following operating systems:
- Mac OSX (10.11)
- Windows 10

If anything is unclear, please contact (Hani Awni)[awni1@vt.edu]
